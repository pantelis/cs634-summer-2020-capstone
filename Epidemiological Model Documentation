Lockdowns are effective.  Infection dynamics die down about 10 days after complete lockdown. \n","\n","2.  Berlin's findings suggest complete lockdown once 10% of hospital capabilities for COVID-19 are in use because:\n","\n","\ta. Infection dynamics continue at home which can triple cases before dynamics slow.  \n","\tb. Many critical cases will occur befor lockdown. Exponential growth will cause large numbers.\n","\n","3. Berlin Simulations say complete removal of infections at child care and primary schools, workplaces, and during leisure activites  would not be sufficient enough to slow down infection dynamics. It would have lead to an improved situation if implemented earlier, however.  \n","\n","4.  Infections in public transport play important role.  Later simulations show reduction in speed of spread and height of peak by about 20%.  This is due to use of lower density of passengers leading to lower infection rates and is not related to a reaction by reducing demand.  \n","\n","5. If initiated early enough in the pandemic, the removal of infections of spaces in Step 3 (closing down workplaces, primary schools, etc.) may have been enough to control infection dynamics. Contact tracing wasn't shown in the model, but Singapore (according to this data), and South Korea managed to control infection rates due to immediate contact tracing according to the study.  Approximations can be made through transport modeling using cell phone data. \n","\n","###---\n","SARS-CoV-2 (also called Covid-19 or coronavirus) is currently the cause of a worldwide pandemic. Without known treatments or vaccines, the best way to combat the disease is to prevent its spread via social distancing and quarantine. This would prevent overloading of hospital beds and staff and as long as each infected person infects less than one other, the virus will die out. \n","\n","The dynamics of the virus are captures in the SIR model, for which S = susceptible, I = infected, and R = recovered. If an infected and susceptible individual are together for some time, there is a probability of infection for the susceptible individual.  This increases as the time spent together increases. The SIR model in our project uses information from the mobility model that captures the movement and number of people in each grid unit and calculates the probability of infection for individuals in the grid. Once the epidemiological model runs, containment strategies will be implemented based on the thresholds risk.\n","\n","The input data for the epidemiological model comes from the mobility model, which shows the activity patterns of individuals throughout NYC. The variables in our model represent the following: <br>\n","N = total population <br>\n","t = time (in hours) <br>\n","S(t) = # of people susceptible at time t <br>\n","I(t) = # of people infected at time t <br>\n","R(t) = # of people recovered at time t <br>\n","β or beta = expected amount of people an infected person infects per day <br>\n","γ or gamma = the proportion of infected recovering per day (γ = 1/D) <br>\n","R₀: the total number of people an infected person infects (R₀ = β / γ) <br>\n","\n","The SIR model implements basic differential equations to show what happens to the population each hour (t) and plots the results with three separate curves for S(t), I(t) and R(t). \n","\n","    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N\n","    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I\n","    dRdt = gamma * I\n","The output from the epidemiological model is then used by the Agent-Based model  that tracks the state (susceptible, infected, or recovered) of each individual.
